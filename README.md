# 🧠 Brain Tumour Classification using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based project to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This system helps in early diagnosis by categorizing brain MRI scans into different tumor types with high accuracy.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Brain tumors are one of the most critical health conditions, and early detection is crucial. This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to analyze MRI images and classify them into different tumor categories, helping doctors and researchers in faster and more reliable diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Automate brain tumor detection from MRI images
* Classify images into tumor categories
* Improve accuracy using deep learning models
* Reduce manual diagnosis effort

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* MRI images of brain scans
* Organized into folders by class (e.g. Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor)
* Preprocessed and resized before training

---

## 🧠 Model Used

* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* TensorFlow / Keras framework
* Image preprocessing and data augmentation applied
